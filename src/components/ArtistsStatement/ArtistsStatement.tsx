        I&#39;ve always preferred working in 3D space when it comes to my
        artistic endeavors. This trend first revealed itself in my youth, where
        I performed in gymnastics and dance. Later, it expanded into sculpture,
        particularly with laser cutting and 3D printing. Today, the vast
        majority of my work lies in computer generated imagery.

        Technically speaking, my earliest experience with CGI was in an
        introduction to web development class I took early on in high school. Of
        course, CGI typically refers to the realm of 3D modeling and animation.
        When I first discovered these, I was immediately enraptured. To this day
        I continue to enjoy programming, but 3D modeling immediately brought me
        more intrinsic motivation and satisfaction than any other medium ever
        has. Over time, as I became more proficient as a 3D generalist, I grew
        more and more interested in some of its more technical elements:
        dynamics, simulation, and procedural modeling. These areas felt like a
        perfect bridge between my interests in the technical and the artistic. I
        am continually amazed at the fine details that a computer can produce in
        almost no time at all.

        I am often intrigued by objects which live at the intersection between
        utility and artistic beauty. Design often prioritizes usability, and
        then considers aesthetics secondarily. Instead I wonder, when a purely
        utilitarian object is given a distinct aesthetic, how does that alter
        the way it is used? I enjoy observing this phenomenon in architecture
        and in the craftsmanship of everyday items, and the concept regularly
        pops up with my work in web-based experiences as well. I am fascinated
        by the way these objects interact with the individuals who use them; how
        an environment can set a mood, or shift a conversation. While other
        artists in CG may be driven by narrative and character, I am most driven
        by how these aesthetics reflect the wealth of experiences that
        constitute our selves. I strive to make immersive experiences which
        every viewer can appreciate for a unique reason.

        I currently work in human-computer interaction, performing a mix of
        frontend development and interface design. In the future, I aim to shift
        focus towards technical art and FX. I&#39;ve also enjoyed dabbling in
        performance, sculpture and installation art, and creative coding, and
        hope for more opportunities to explore these areas somewhere down the
        road.
